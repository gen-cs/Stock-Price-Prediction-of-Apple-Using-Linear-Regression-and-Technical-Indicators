• Designed and implemented a linear regression model to predict Apple Inc. stock prices,
integrating technical indicators such as 5-day and 20-day moving averages, lagged
returns of Apple and S&P 500 index, and cross-market variables to capture market
dynamics and trends.

• Validated regression assumptions using statistical tests such as VIF for multicollinearity,
Breusch-Pagan for heteroscedasticity, QQ plot for normality, and Durbin-Watson for
autocorrelation, ensuring model robustness and reliability.

• Evaluated model performance through in-sample and out-of-sample prediction accuracy,
applying Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as
quantitative metrics to measure prediction error, and visualized results through residual
plots and prediction comparison charts.
